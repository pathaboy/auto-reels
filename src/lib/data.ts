      "imageDescription": "King Krishnadevaraya, a regal man in his 40s with a golden crown, deep-set eyes, and a richly embroidered red and gold robe, walks through a dimly lit jail corridor lined with iron-barred cells. The stone walls are cold and damp, with torches flickering, casting long shadows. Two thieves, appearing scruffy with unkempt hair, tattered brown tunics, and anxious expressions, kneel before the king, pleading for mercy while guards in silver armor stand watch.",

      "imageDescription": "In the grand palace hall, King Krishnadevaraya, seated on an ornate golden throne, speaks to the two burglars standing before him. The burglars, now hopeful, bow respectfully. The hall is adorned with intricate wall carvings, and sunlight streams through arched windows. The king gestures toward them, issuing a challenge to break into his advisor Tenali Raman’s house, while royal courtiers observe in silence.",

      "imageDescription": "Under the cover of night, two thieves dressed in dark rags crouch behind thick bushes outside Tenali Raman’s house. The house, a modest traditional Indian home with a sloping tiled roof, is dimly lit from within. The garden is lush with potted plants and a large tree, its branches swaying under the moonlight. Crickets chirp in the background, and a faint rustling sound is heard from the bushes where the thieves hide.",

      "imageDescription": "Tenali Raman, a middle-aged man with a neatly tied turban and a thin mustache, steps onto his veranda for a stroll. Wearing a simple dhoti and a shawl, he pauses and looks towards the bushes, his keen eyes sensing movement. The night sky is clear with stars twinkling, and a gentle breeze sways the trees. He smirks knowingly before heading inside, leaving the door slightly ajar.",

      "imageDescription": "Inside his well-lit home, Tenali Raman, standing near a wooden trunk, speaks loudly to his wife, who wears a simple saree and listens attentively. He instructs her to gather all their gold, silver, and jewelry and place them inside the trunk. The thieves, still hiding outside, press their ears to the window, intently eavesdropping. The flickering oil lamp casts long shadows on the wooden walls, and the air is tense with anticipation.",

      "imageDescription": "Tenali Raman, carrying the heavy wooden trunk with both hands, walks through his backyard toward a deep stone well. His face remains calm and determined. The well, covered in moss and surrounded by small flowering plants, stands under the soft glow of the moonlight. The thieves peek from the bushes, their eyes widening in excitement as they see Tenali drop the trunk into the well with a loud splash.",

    {
      "imageDescription": "As soon as Tenali Raman enters his house, the two thieves stealthily emerge from their hiding spot and rush toward the well. One thief, muscular with a beard, quickly grabs a bucket, while the other, lean with short hair, starts pulling the rope. The cold night air fills with the sound of splashing water as they take turns drawing bucket after bucket, their clothes soaked and faces strained with effort.",

      "imageDescription": "The first rays of dawn spread across the sky as the exhausted thieves, drenched in sweat and water, finally pull the heavy trunk out of the well. Their faces light up in triumph. As they hurriedly open the trunk, their expressions turn to shock and disbelief. Instead of gold and silver, they find large, mossy stones piled inside. The realization of being tricked dawns on them.",

      "imageDescription": "Tenali Raman steps out of his house with a playful smile, arms crossed, as he watches the bewildered thieves. His garden, now freshly watered, glistens in the soft morning light. He thanks the thieves for their hard work in helping him sleep peacefully and for watering his plants. The thieves, embarrassed and defeated, lower their heads and apologize, understanding that they have been outsmarted.",
